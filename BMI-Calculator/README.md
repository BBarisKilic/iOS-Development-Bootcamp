# BMI Calculator
A Body Mass Index Calculator app. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many pies or if they need to eat more pies. The project has been written solely in Swift Language.

## Through this project, I've learned:
-	How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
-   Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
-   How to create classes and difference between classes and structs.
-   Pass by value vs. pass by reference.
-   Formatting Strings.
-   Color literals.
