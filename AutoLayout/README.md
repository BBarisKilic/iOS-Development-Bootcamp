# Auto Layout
An app that simply displays an image at the center of the screen. Auto Layout allows us to set rules as to how we want our views to be displayed. Because mobile screens have different resolutions and sizes, we need these rules to tell the iPhone/iPad how it should layout all the elements in the storyboard onto the display. These rules allow our UI elements to be resized and positioned so that no matter which screen they are displayed on, they always look as the designer intended. The project has been written solely in Swift Language.

## Through this project, I've learned how to:
-	add constraints and understanding how Auto Layout works.
-   Pin and Align elements.
-   create containers to configure advanced layouts.
-   debug auto layout errors.
-   use Stack Views to create complex interfaces.
