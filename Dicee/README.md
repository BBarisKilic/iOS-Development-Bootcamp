# Dicee

## What you will create

We’re going to make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. With this app in your pocket, you’ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!


## Through this project, I've learned how to:

-   clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
-   create an app with behaviour and functionality.
-   create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
-   get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
-   to use comments to annotate code.
-   use Swift constants and variables.
-   use collection types such as Swift arrays.
-   test and debug app with the Xcode console.
-   generate random numbers in Swift.
